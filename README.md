# hello-world

Hi people from github, I'm new at this page, I don't know to speak enghish, so, if you notice some mistakes in my writing (it is becouse of my english is not good at all).

I dont already know how github works (not exactly yet) but I'm liking it becouse I enjoy learning something new.
